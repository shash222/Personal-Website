        "answer": "I became interested in technology at a very young age. I built my first computer when I was in the sixth grade, and loved every aspect of the process.

        "question": "What is the personal project that you are the most proud of?",
        "answer": "I am most proud of the RUDestination project that I am currently working on. With Rutgers being a massive school with 5 sub-campuses that require bus transportation to get between them, it becomes overwhelming trying to get from class to class. Not only am I able to put my technical and design skills to the test, but also provide new and transfer students peace of mind while trying to navigate through the campuses.",
